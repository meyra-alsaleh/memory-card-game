# memory-card-game

A simple memory card flip game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that reveals the faces of Korean artists that I am a fan of. It uses a JSON file as a source of data and a CSS grid to create the layout. 
Furthermore, a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm is implemented for randomizing the cards and a scoring system to keep track of your progress. You can select the artist cards by choosing the artist name from the dropdown.


This game was bult by following a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWdkt6KSirw&list=PLzbvwNw6qetvjThI87rN030IJSE0XVwXS&index=2&t=317s)
